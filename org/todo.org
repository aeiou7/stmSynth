* IDEA vco
** wavetables
wavetable based sound generation, goal is to create smooth interpolation between wave states that is toggleable, to get a smooth or stepped wavemorph.
*** 2 or 3 dimensions
maybe make it 2d or 3d wavetables, inspired by 4ms svn or piston honda
*** cv pos input
cv input along with attenuator and pot/fader to control wavetable position.
** pitch and octave switch
classic pitch pot and octave switch
*** v/oct input pitch
cv input for pitch control, utilizing v/oct
** fm/ringmod/phasemod/sync inputs
sound modulation options to add for more sound design options, each with associated attenuator on input.
* IDEA sequencer/pam clone
the basic idea will be a pams workout where the default mode is a 303 style sequencer. this means that each would be clock output from pams would be 4 outputs, that can all be assigned to waveforms on that clock speed, or be used by the sequencer
** UI
*** data knob
we will use pams clickable encoder design for the main menu operations, maybe i will try two click encoders and replace the back button on the original menu ideas.
*** oled screen
oled display that will be like the pam or elektron screens, if i go dual knob i will try to consider some of elektrons flow.
** accent mode
accents will now be a whole 303 mode like pitch and time is, cloning the pitch mode to add dynamic movement in the accenting, this mode will also be used for assigning the mod output.
*** envelops
this mode allows envelopes to be sent on certain note outputs, these can be configured on the screen with the data entry.
envelopes can be decay, attack/decay and adsr
** inputs

** outputs
each of the 8 channels will have the following outputs that can be assigned to diffrent modes and clock divisions like on pam.
*** cv1: v/oct
in default mode this would be a v/oct output for the 303 sequencer,
*** cv2: accent
in default mode this would be the 303's accent output, can be used to send static values, slides between accents or envelopes like the mod output.
*** cv3: mod
in default mode this would be a new addition to the 303 sequencer, allowing envelopes to be generated and sent, or for it to behave like a second accent
*** cv4: gate/trig
in default mode this owuld be the gate/trigger output.
* IDEA filter
filter bank inspired by qpas, i want a spicy multi filter!
* IDEA noie
noise module utilizing gameboy carts to get random data for noise. noise would be generated from windows of data on the input that can be scanned through like a wavetable, the length of the scan window can be determined, allowing non noise sounds to be synthesized possibly.
